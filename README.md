## ABOUT ME
Hello, I am a person who has a strong passion for programming. I have experience in creating SPA with React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript.
At the moment I am improving my skills in this direction and expanding them with the help of new technologies.
I'd like to learn Angular and Node.js because my next goal is to become a Full-Stack developer.
I spend my free time playing Codewars or with educational books in English.
Open for your suggestions.
